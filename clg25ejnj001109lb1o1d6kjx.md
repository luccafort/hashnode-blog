Go Conference is one of the biggest Golang conferences in Japan.

Then I work as Ruby and Go developer, I enjoy to join this conference.  
One day, Go Conference Organizer told me, "do you join us as Go Conference Volunteer staff member?".

I reply to "Yes! Let's make it!".

```plaintext
$ lets make go-confenrece 2023
> Congratiratons join me luccafort!
```

Because I love Golang, All Gophers, and Golang ecosystem!

if you want to be a Go Conference Volunteer staff member, you send a request message to tenntenn or else Go Conference Volunteer members.

thank you.
